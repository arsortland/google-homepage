With this project i shall replicate the front page of google with the tools given to me so far in the odin project course.

Edit: After around 3 hours of fooling around and not using any developer tool other than to copy some colors i have gotten a result that kinda resembles google's homepage.

I found it difficult to align text on the same line on both the left and right side (for the footer) and used most of the time getting that in order.

The rest went fairly well and i felt that i could write most of the code based on what i have learned. 
My google-fu was also quite on point and i felt i never were stuck.
